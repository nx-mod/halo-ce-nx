/* render_epoch.h

The render epoch: the window in which a game tick (on its own thread,
tick_thread.c) runs alongside the render of the frame before it. The render
walks game state the tick relinks (cluster reference lists, object headers,
effects, decals, lights), and Halo's accessors assume nothing is torn from
under them. Rather than guarding each structure, the epoch makes the tick's
reclamation lazy:

  - a datum the tick deletes is tombstoned: its memory and identifier stay
    intact until the join, the tick's own accessors and iterators treat it as
    gone, the render's still see it (and draw it one frame late at worst);
  - a datum the tick creates is hidden from the render's iterators, whose
    scans would otherwise meet it half-initialised;
  - a memory pool block the tick frees stays allocated until the join;
  - a reference-list insert publishes its node with a release fence.

Stale links then always lead to intact nodes: an unlinked node keeps its
next pointer, no slot is reused, and relinks only ever skip forward, so a
walker mixing old and new links terminates.

The tick thread is the mutator; the game thread (the render) the reader.
The epoch ends at the join, which sweeps the tombstones and frees the
deferred blocks on the game thread, alone. */
