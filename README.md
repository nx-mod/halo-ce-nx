# Halo: Combat Evolved for Switch

A native Nintendo Switch port of **Halo: Combat Evolved**, built from the
Xbox decompilation. Not an emulator — the game's own code runs natively
on the Switch's CPU, and its Direct3D rendering is translated to GLES3.

**Status: early.** No build yet. See [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) for where
things stand and what's left.

**No game data is included.** You need your own Xbox copy of Halo:
Combat Evolved — the PC version's maps don't work.

## Building

Not yet functional for Switch. The source currently builds for Linux,
Windows and the PS Vita (this repo's base); see those platforms'
`port/*/README.md`. Switch build instructions will land here once
`port/switch/` exists.
